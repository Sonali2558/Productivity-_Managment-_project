A Google  chrome extension which helps user to be more productive while using **GOOGLE CHROME**</br>
This program is written in **HTML** , **CSS** , **JAVASCRIPT**.</br>
**FEATURES**</br>
The **popup** contains two buttons "Start" and "Settings". Clicking on "Start" activates the productive state, which will block websites that are part of the blocked list. Clicking on Settings would create a new tab with the HTML page for the settings.</br>

When the user first starts the extension, it by default blocks the major social media websites i.e Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram. If the user wants to block more websites to be productive, the user can change the blocked list through the **Settings** page! The user also can add more websites for the extension to block and can also remove websites from the list!</br>

This program also includes a **timer** (counting up) and a **distraction counter** so the user can keep track of their productivity.</br>

When the user goes to a page that should be blocked. The active tab redirects them to the **blocked page**. It basically only shows that the page is blocked and the user can just go back to the last page.</br>
